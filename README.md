## 🚀 Our Mission: Democratizing Financial Data

**FinBase** is an ambitious open-source initiative to build the world's first global, collaborative, and free financial asset database. We are creating a foundational layer of high-quality, accessible data to empower researchers, developers, and independent traders everywhere.

## ✨ Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Open & Free Access** | Financial data available to everyone, without paywalls or closed barriers. |
| **Community Driven** | A project built by the community, for the community. |
| **Quality & Transparency**| High standards for data validation, cleaning, and traceability. |
| **Scalable Architecture** | A solid technological foundation designed to grow with demand. |
| **Constant Evolution** | From using third-party data to becoming a primary, reliable source. |

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AmericoGarciaG/FinBase.git
cd finbase

# 2. Navigate to a specific service to run it
cd services/collector-yfinance

# 3. Follow the instructions in the service's README to launch it
docker compose up --build
```

## 🧠 System Architecture

FinBase is built on a decoupled microservices architecture, where each component is an independent, replaceable, and scalable building block communicating via a message bus.

### High-Level Data Flow

```
[Data Sources] -> [Collectors] -> [Raw Data Queue] -> [Quality Service] -> [Clean Data Queue] -> [Storage Service] -> [Database] -> [API] -> [Users]
```

## 📦 Microservices Ecosystem

This monorepo contains all microservices that power the FinBase ecosystem.

| Service | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **[`collector-yfinance`](services/collector-yfinance)** | ✅ **Active** | Production-ready data collector for Yahoo Finance. |
| **[`quality-service`](services/quality-service)** | ✅ **Active** | The gatekeeper for data integrity and validation. |
| **`storage-service`** | 🚧 **In Development** | Persists clean data into the TimescaleDB database. |
| **`api-service`** | 📝 **Planned** | Exposes the data via a high-performance REST/WebSocket API. |

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Core Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **Message Bus**: RabbitMQ
- **Database**: TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL for time-series)
- **API Framework**: FastAPI (Planned)

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap

1.  **Phase 1: Data Ingestion & Quality (Current)**
    -   Develop multiple collectors for different sources.
    -   Build a robust, extensible data quality service.

2.  **Phase 2: Storage & Access**
    -   Implement the storage service for efficient data persistence.
    -   Develop a high-performance API for data retrieval.

3.  **Phase 3: Community & Expansion**
    -   Create tools and libraries for easy data consumption.
    -   Establish partnerships to become a primary data source.
