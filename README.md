## üöÄ Our Mission: Democratizing Financial Data

**FinBase** is an ambitious open-source initiative to build the world's first global, collaborative, and free financial asset database. We are creating a foundational layer of high-quality, accessible data to empower researchers, developers, and independent traders everywhere.

## ‚ú® Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Open & Free Access** | Financial data available to everyone, without paywalls or closed barriers. |
| **Community Driven** | A project built by the community, for the community. |
| **Quality & Transparency**| High standards for data validation, cleaning, and traceability. |
| **Scalable Architecture** | A solid technological foundation designed to grow with demand. |
| **Constant Evolution** | From using third-party data to becoming a primary, reliable source. |

## ‚ö° Quick Start: See it in Action!

### 1. Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose

### 2. Launch the Entire System
From the root of the project, run one command:
```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```
This will build and start all 7 microservices in the correct order.

### 3. Explore the FinBase Ecosystem
Once everything is running, you can access the full platform:

-   **üìà Live Charting UI:** Open your browser to **[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)**
-   **üìñ API Documentation:** Explore the interactive API docs at **[http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)**
-   **üì¨ Message Queue Admin:** Monitor the data flow in RabbitMQ at **[http://localhost:15672](http://localhost:15672)** (user: `guest`, pass: `guest`)

## üß† System Architecture

FinBase is built on a decoupled microservices architecture. It features two primary data flows: a real-time ingestion pipeline and an on-demand historical backfilling system.

#### Live Data Flow
```
[collector-yfinance] -> [raw_data_queue] -> [quality-service] -> [clean_data_queue] -> [storage-service] -> [finbase-db]
```

#### Backfill Flow
```
[User via API] -> [api-service] -> [backfill_jobs_queue] -> [backfill-worker] -> [raw_data_queue] (re-joins main flow)
```

#### Data Access Flow
```
[finbase-db] <--> [api-service] <--> [frontend-service] / [External Apps]
```

## üì¶ Microservices Ecosystem

This monorepo contains all microservices that power the FinBase ecosystem.

| Service | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **[`collector-yfinance`](services/collector-yfinance)** | ‚úÖ **Active** | Continuously fetches the latest market data. |
| **[`quality-service`](services/quality-service)** | ‚úÖ **Active** | The gatekeeper for data integrity and validation. |
| **[`storage-service`](services/storage-service)** | ‚úÖ **Active** | Efficiently persists clean data into the TimescaleDB. |
| **[`api-service`](services/api-service)** | ‚úÖ **Active** | Exposes data via a high-performance REST & WebSocket API. |
| **[`backfill-worker`](services/backfill-worker-service)**| ‚úÖ **Active** | Executes on-demand historical data backfilling jobs. |
| **[`frontend-service`](services/frontend-service)** | ‚úÖ **Active** | An interactive charting UI built with React & TradingView. |
| **`rabbitmq` / `finbase-db`** | ‚úÖ **Active**| Core infrastructure for messaging and storage. |

## üîß Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, Pydantic
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, TypeScript, Nginx
- **Database**: TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL for time-series)
- **Message Bus**: RabbitMQ
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **Testing**: Pytest

## üß™ End-to-End Testing

The project includes a comprehensive End-to-End (E2E) test suite that validates the entire backfilling pipeline, from API request to data verification.

To run the tests after starting the system:
```bash
# 1. Copy test files into the running api-service container
docker cp ./tests api-service:/tmp/

# 2. Execute pytest inside the container
docker exec api-service python -m pytest -v /tmp/tests/
```

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Core System (Completed)
-   Real-time data ingestion pipeline.
-   Robust, on-demand historical backfilling system.
-   High-performance API with REST and WebSocket support.
-   Interactive charting front-end.
-   Fully containerized, one-command deployment.
-   End-to-End testing framework.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Phase 2: Expansion & Hardening (Next Steps)
-   **Add More Data Providers:** Integrate new collectors and backfill providers (e.g., Binance for crypto, other stock exchanges).
-   **Implement Caching:** Add a Redis layer to the `api-service` for enhanced performance.
-   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automate testing and deployment using GitHub Actions.
-   **User Authentication:** Secure the frontend and parts of the API.
